Changes in version 5
-----------------------

- Now installs 3.90 M33-3 instead of 3.80 M33-5
- Integration with timemachine in case it is installed.
---

Installation:
 
- Beginning at this version, DC uses same iplloader than timemachine which usually doesn't require to mspformat the memory stick.
However, in some memory stick it may still be necessary.
Just run the program and if you find an error, run mspformat and try again.
 
- Copy DC5 to PSP/GAME/
 
- Download 1.50, 3.40 and 3.90 update eboots and copy them to ms root with
150.PBP, 340.PBP and 390.PBP names.

- If you have a PTF custom theme set, quit it before running the program.
 
- Use the app under a cfw with 2.x or 3.x kernel (be sure that kernel is 
selected on recovery to the correct one (2.x or 3.x))
 
- IF timemachine is installed in this memory stick, the program will ask you which button(s) you want to boot DC5, otherwise no buttons will be necessary.
 
- Now you can delete 340 and 150 PBP's, as they won't be used more; but 390.PBP
will be used for unbricker, so don't delete it.
 
- Now you have an universal pandora ms ready to go, and you just need a proper
battery. If you have 1.50 kernel access, use c+d tool. Otherwise, use corly149 tool.
 
Battery and ms will work on all psp and slims to this date.

Unbricking: 
 
- Press X to install 3.90M33. 
 
- Press O to install original 3.90 
 
- Press [] to dump nand to nand-dump.bin. When done, psp will auto shutdown.
 
- Press L+R+HOME+start to restore nand from nand-dump.bin
 
This proccess is very dangerous, and you should *just* use it if it's your
last chance to get it working.
 
This is a physical restore process (not a logical one), and will try to make 
a 100% exact clon of the dump.
 
If you are working with a dump that isn't yours, you will get either a brick
or a corrupt idstorage, depending on the firmware.
 
If while you are restoring your psp have got any damaged block more than 
when you dumped it, you might also get a brick, depending on what block is it.
 
Works for both PSP and PSP Slim.

----

Note: If you are gonna use the memory stick to restore a psp other than the one that created it,
check if the file /TM/DC5/registry/act.dat exists in the ms. If it exists, remove it, otherwise the restored psp may not be able
to buy psn games until the user doesn't delete from flash2 the act.dat of the other psp. (act.dat files are unique for each psp).

Note that act.dat will be restored to the moment of the MS creation. 
If you have bought other PSN game later, the act.dat file may have changed and if you restore the old one, you may loose the latest bought game.
Backup flash2:/act.dat each time after you buy something from the PSN!
