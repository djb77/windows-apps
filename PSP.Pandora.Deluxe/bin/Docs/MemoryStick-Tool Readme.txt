Credit goes to Hellcat for helping me with the Formatting Function. Thanks Hellcat =D


Memorystick-Tool v1.5
----------------------
This homebrew application is to revive corrupted memorystick's. It also has a few
other tools like dumping the MBR of the memorystick etc.. See for yourself. FAT32
Formatting is still under construction so i would NOT recommend using it.
Anyway, many thanks to Hellcat.

Usage
----------------------
To fix a corrupted memorystick you need a working memorystick.
Put my homebrew application on a working memorystick. Load up
my application on the PSP. Go on "Repair Memorystick : FAT16"
and press X, It should ask you to insert the corrupted memorystick.
Do that now. Then press X again. If everything worked, you should
have a working memorystick. My application doesnt always work
as their could be physical faults with the stick itself.
