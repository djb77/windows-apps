CPU-Modulator by Lokiare

I am not responsible for anything this program does to anything you or any else owns.
In short "I am not responsible for anything anytime."

Revisions
v0.20:
     Log output doesn't work right.
     Added support for full range of speeds from 96 to 333.
     When logging it seems to lock it in at around 222.
v0.11:
     Fixed log output. now outputs to "cpumodulatorlog.txt".
v0.10:
     Modulates between 333, 222, 111, and 95 automatically.
     Removed annoying text onscreen.
     Added logging support (change logging=1 to 0 for no logging)
v0.01:
     Created.
     Modulates between 333 and 222 automatically.

Install:
     To install this program extract the files to the ms0:/seplugins/ folder. 
Then open cpumodulator.ini file and set logging to 1 (on) or 0 (off).
Then open vsh.txt, game.txt, and pops.txt and add the line "ms0:/seplugins/cpumodulator.prx" to the ones you want to be able to use.
Then load up into your recovery menu (turn psp off and hold R-button while turning it on). 
Go to Plugins and enable cpumodulator in VSH (for menu and UMD video), game, and/or pops. 
Then exit and it should load up.

It is suggested that you run it with logging off (unless you want a lot of file writes to slow down the PSP).
