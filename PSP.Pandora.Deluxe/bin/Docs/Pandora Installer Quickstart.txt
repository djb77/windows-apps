OK, here's a very short guide for a very easy setup of a complete Pandora set!

Including the preparations of the memstick.
Without hazzeling around with the commanprompt tools for Windows,
all done from the PSP with a few simple button presses!


1)
Make sure you have nothing on the memstick you want to keep!
Now FORMAT the memstick with the PSPs function for doing so
from Systemconfig => Format MemStick

2)
Copy the folder "pan3xx" from this archive to /PSP/GAME on your memstick, and run it

3)
Press R+X, and confirm with R+L+X to repartition and format the memstick
(this is needed to reserve space for the MS IPL)

4)
Restart the PSP and connect it to the PC again via USB.
Create the folder /PSP and then /PSP/GAME on the memstick.
Copy (again ;-)) the folder "pan3xx" from this archive to /PSP/GAME

5)
Copy the official 1.50 updater, named as UPDATE.PBP, to the root of your memstick.
(X:\UPDATE.PBP, if X is the driveletter of your PSP)

6)
Run the "Pandora for 3.xx" installer again.
This time press X to install all files to the memstick.

7)
When the copy of the files is finished, press L+X, when asked to do so.

8)
Restart the installer once again and press O to make your battery to a Pandora one

9)
Press /\ to finally exit the installer.


You have a full set of a Pandora Magic MemoryStick and a Pandora Battery now!
Enjoy!

Like it? I certainly do :-)
