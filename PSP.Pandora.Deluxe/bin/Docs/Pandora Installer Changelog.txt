Changes in Rev4b

- replaced DDCv6 install with DDCv7

- replaced ELF-Menu 0.3 with 0.4 for DDCv4 additional tools


Changes in Rev4a

- added installation of DDCv6


Changes in Rev4:

- added a new menu system for more easy navigation of all available options
  (I ran out of buttons for new functions *lol*)
  Usage should be a bit more easy now, less confusion....

- added option to install TimeMachine IPL to the MemStick
  (the IPL is build in, not required to have it as file on the MemStick)

- added option for installing a DDC stick! ("Desparter Del Cementario", or however it's spelled ;-) )
  Now you can finally make a MagicStick with this app that also works perfectly on the Slim and
  installs a recent CFW! :-)
  No need for any additional tools or setups.
  (3.40 module extraction based on M33's PSARDumper)

- added option to modify a DDC MagicStick to launch ELF-Menu, instead of the original
  DDC ressurection.elf - already presupplied with NAND-Tool (propperly set up) and the
  original ressurection to be launched from the menu.
  For all you maintanance needs :-)

- It now looks for the 1.50 updater under "150.PBP", no longer under "UPDATE.PBP"!

- added a small check for all required .PBPs, displays a small notice when some are missing



Changes in Rev3b:

- added a warning/notice if the program detects a TA-085-v2+ mainboard



Changes from Rev2b to Rev3:

- Uses direct hardware access code from Silverspring to set battery serial, so it should work on 3.80 as well....

- Can write and read back the serial to file (ms0:/batser.bin) - you can also use this to customize the serial by editing this file with a hexeditor before reading it back in
(if a restore from file is attempted without the file beeing present, the default serial will just be used instead ;))

- Now shows current battery serial on main menu screen

- Upon request (and due to be found cool :D) you can also choose/set the name of the memorystick after reformatting :)
Like for the battery serial, put a file "msname.txt" in the root of your memstick, containing the name you want.
