Alternative VSHMenù by Red Squirrel

N.B.: I'm Italian, so sorry for my BAD english :P

What's it?
It is an Alternative VSHMenù that has ALL same functions of the M33 VshMenù and other utilities such as the possibility to change the background color, to power off and to sleep the console, to activate and to disactivate M33 VshMenù from dashboard or to make screenshot of XMB!
Press HOME (by Default) in XMB to start the Alternative VshMenù!
Press CIRCLE (by Default) in Menù to close it.

Note: 
-Do not flash this plugin erasing M33 satelite.prx! In this case Alternative VSHMenù does not work!
-The Homebrew-Flasher used in this version is still a beta so use it only at your own risk.
If you want to use the "old" method to flash the plugin, please follow the guide inserted in Patch2Flash folder!
-In this version language translation are included in the plugin! So the .PRX file size has been increased: for this reason, if you want to flash it, be sure to have the need free space in your Flash0 before beginning the flashing process!!!
In future I will insert language translation in a separated file to avoid this issue.
-In this version there are only two language: English and Italian.
If you want, you can make a particular translation of A. VSHMenù and then send it to me at redsquirrel@psp-cheats.it.
But please, don't use very long words! Indeed try to use the exact number of letter used by English Traslation.
-By default the SELECT button will be associated to a homebrew: so place one in PSP/GAME/HOMEBREW/ directory, or disable/change that option.
If you press SELECT when it is associated to a homebrew but no homebrew is in /PSP/GAME/HOMEBREW/ directory PSP will freeze!

Features
v6.1
-Fixed a bug that disabled the first plugin in VSH.txt when you exit from the VSHMenù.

v6.0
- Added FIVE new background colours
- Now Alternative VSHMenù can not be started before of 3 seconds: in this way you can avoid console crashes when you accidentally start it during coldboot or returning from games.
- Now there will be a pause of about one second when you exit from A. VSHMenù: in this way your key pressing will not have any effect on XMB (like happened in past).
- Changed HIDE MAC ADDRESS function in AUTO USB CONNECTION: if you enable it, USB connection will be enable always in XMB! In this way when you connect a USB cable your PSP will be connected to your PC/PS3 without you have to press on special icon! (like in PSP-3000).
- Changed CXMB PLUGIN function in LANGUAGE: now you can select your language from the menu of A. VSHMenù! In this first version, there will be only two language: Italian and English.
- Changed M33 VSHMENU in SELECT KEY: now you can choose what to associate to SELECT key in XMB (M33 VSHMenù, a Homebrew, Nothing).
- Erased all difference of code between CF 3.90/3.95GEN/4.01M33: now plugin will be the same in all CFs.
- Added a homebrew-flasher for the plugin: it will flash the Alternative VSHMenù in your Flash0 directly from PSP without other steps!
- Cleaned the code to try to compensate the increase of the PRX size caused by language translations.

v5.0
{
CF 3.90M33
-Possibility to hide the MAC address in System Information page (like CF 3.93/3.95GEN option!)
-Now PSP will be rebooted if you change CXMB, MAC or M33 VSHMenù options (to enable the changes!).

CF 3.95GEN
-Added Hide MAC Address option.
-Changed "M33 NET UPD." line in "NETWORK UPD.".
-Added GEN Updater under NETWORK UPDATE option.
-Changed "M33 VshMenu" line in "SELECT KEY ".
-Added VSH Recovery under SELECT KEY option.

BOTH
-Possibility to enable/disable CXMB plugin directly from the VSHMenù (read the CXMB installation in CXMB_readme.txt to know how it works)
-Now config file will be saved in flash1, so if you decide to flash the A.Vshmenù, Memory Stick will not be required!
-Added a Slim Flasher
-Because of lack of time, language translations will be released in next update.
}

v4.2
-There was a bug in v4.1 on PSPs Slim that brought to the reboot of the console when you closed Alternative VSHMenù: FIXED.

v4.1
-Added German, Italian and French translations.
-Added a tool to flash the plugin in Flash0 (so you can free a space for a new plugin in your PSP!).

v4.0
-Added a security check to the plugin.
This because of a lamer team, called "Team Just Dead", creator (but I have some doubt about it too...) of the "JD-Battery", that when I released the v3.5 they diffused a hex-edit spanish version of my Alternative VSHMenù saying that they were its programmers and creators...
-Added the NO PIC0 AND PIC1 function
-Added the GAME KERNEL function for PSP Fat
-Added the USB CHARGE function for PSP Slim.
-GAME KERNEL and USBCHARGE functions share the same line, so if you use Alternative VSHMenù on a PSP Fat the GAME KERNEL function will appear, otherwise on a Slim the function USB CHEARGE will appear.
-Now when you change one of the functions that requires the reboot of the console to be applied (Game Kernel, USB Charge, M33 Network Update, No Pic1.png and Pic0.png), Dashboard will be restarted automatically, applying the change!
-Some minor bugfix and improvement to the code.

Note: Because of lack of time, translations will be released later.


v3.5
-Changed the disposition of menu lines to avoid to occupy all PSP screen height.
-Added a function to enable/disable M33 Network Update.
-Now when VSHMenù begins, the button "Shutdown PSP" will be selected as the first. In this way the process of PSP turning off, reboot and standby is quickly.
-Added 2 new versions of the PRX: one of them is the Italian translation (by Red Squirrel) and the other is the French Translation (by Britix).

v3.1
-[FIX]- In CF 3.80M33 Standby function did not work. Now it works.

v3.0
-Fixed problems with USB device setting when UMD9660 were selected.
-Last USB Device chosen will be saved, so at PSP reboot default USB Device will be last one chosen.
-Changes to CPU and BUS frequency will be applied immediately on menù closing, without requiring console reboot.
-Add UMD-VIDEO function (like M33 VSHMenù)
-ISOs in ISO/VIDEO directory will be checked on every VSHmenù beginning, so changes (adding/removing ISO) will be realized immeditely without requiring console reboot!
-Now pressing again the "start" key VSHMenù will close itself.

v2.0
-Improved the management of the colors
-Disposition of the commands on the screen is changed
-Possibility to make screenshot of the dashboard
-Possibility to activate/disactivate the function of screenshot
-Possibility to choose the key to start the plugin!
-Possibility to choose the key to make the screenshot
-Now options will be saved, so changes will be maintained also on the reboot of the console!
-If the file or th folder of options are not found, they will automatically be created to avoid crash of the system.

v1.00 Standard
-Same functions of M33 VshMenù
-Possibility to change the background color
-Possibility to activate or disactivate M33 VshMenù
-Possibility to power off, reboot and sleep the console
-Plugin will stop PSP to avoid conflict with pad

v1.00 Memory
-Same functions of standard versione except for usbdevice.prx that will be loaded from SEPLUGINS folder in Memory Stick and not from Flash0
-Dark_Alex fixed usbdevice.prx is already present in the Alternative VSHMenù folder.
