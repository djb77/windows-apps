Q: What is JoySens?
A: JoySens is a custom firmware plugin for Sony PSP that allows you to control the sensitivity of the analog stick in a very
   efficient way as well as "repair" faulty analog sticks. In very bad cases where the analog stick is not repairable, you
   can also just disable it so it doesn't interfere with your games anymore.
   Apart from that it includes functionality to swap and remap DPad input to analog stick and vice versa, hence allows you
   to control the XMB with the analog stick for example.


Q: How do I set JoySens to be able to control the XMB with the analog?
A: Make sure that forceanalog is set to 1 in the ini (default) and change the remap mode to Analog->DPad (2) or Analog<->DPad (3)
   if you still want to be able to give analog input in some way (for the photo viewer or browser).


Q: My analog stick is messed up and lets my characters move in random directions even when I don't touch it!
A: When the direction tends to always be the same, it's very likely that your analog stick is just off-centered.
   In that case you need to adjust the center value in the ini to match your analog stick. You'll find good values for
   it by leaving the analog stick untouched and watching the first pair of values in the first line of the info output.
   Try to find a good average of the values you see and put those in the ini file. Restart your PSP and check if the second
   pair of values in the first line of the info output stay at <0,0> when the analog stick is untouched and repeat the steps
   from above if it doesn't.
   Alternatively, you can try to use the semi-automatic center functionality. See the readme for exact instructions on that.

   If the directions are completely random and never go in the same direction, it's probably just that the analog stick is
   too responsive. In that case, try setting the adjust parameter to something like 2.0 - 2.5. Then slowly increase the value
   until the ghost movement is gone.


Q: My analog stick doesn't recognize input to the left/right/top/bottom!
A: Check the first line of the info output when pressing the analog stick in that direction. If the analog stick scales correctly
   you should see values -128 (up or left) or 127 (down or right) as the first (left or right) or second (up or down) coordinate.
   So if you move your stick to the left, you should see <-128,*>, to the right you should see <127,*>, pulling up you should see
   <*,-128> and down you should see <*,127>. If the values are smaller (bigger) your analog stick is messed up and you need to adjust
   the min/max values in the ini file to represent the minimal/maximal values you get when moving the stick to the extremes.
   Let's say you get values <-128,-101> to <96,127> then edit the ini file and set min to <-128,-98> and max to <93,127> or equal.
   You should decrease the non maximum values a bit (by 2-3 is good in most cases) since those values are not 100% correct, so
   you might still end up with unresponsive input with the exact values.
   Now restart the plugin (by starting a homebrew/game or restarting the PSP) and check if analog stick is responsive again. If not
   try to decrease the values further until it is.


Q: My analog stick is unuseable, no matter what settings I try. How do I go about disabling it?
A: Set the adjust parameter to 0 and the analog stick gets disabled.


Q: JoySens doesn't work in CFW x.xx (>3.80)!
A: Try formating your flash1 in the recovery menu (reboot while holding R trigger). If it still won't work,
   also try formating your memory stick from the settings menu (make a backup first).
   If it still won't work, you can contact me with information on the firmware you use and I'll take a look.
