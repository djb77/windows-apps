Pandora ELF & PBP Menu 0.4
-- jas0nuk
**************************

Usage and features
******************
Here's an updated version of my ELF menu, now with PBP support and working with Despertar del Cementerio v5

Replace ms0:/TM/DC5/kd/resurrection.elf on your magic memory stick with the one included in this archive; the PSP will then load it when you insert the Pandora battery & memory stick, and it will show a list of ELFs and PBPs inside the ms0:/elf folder

Use D-Pad up/down to choose the application you want to run, and press X.
Hold HOME and press D-pad up/down to reload the menu if you encounter an issue

The menu fully identifies the PSP motherboard version without the need for IdStorage for diagnostic purposes

There seem to be problems loading applications if the filename contains spaces or symbols, so use underscores(_) instead. These will be converted to spaces on the menu.

Applications containing _SLIM or _FAT at the end of the filename (e.g. blah_SLIM.elf) will be greyed out if the menu is not running on that model.
For example, keyCleaner_FAT.elf will be greyed out and unselectable on a Slim PSP.

If the ELF/PBP fails to run, the screen usually flickers and reloads the ELF menu. It is recommended that you use ELFs with this menu, however PBPs are now supported.

The menu also has a built in submenu for USB access to the memory stick and various flash partitions. See further down for specific information on setting this up.

Finally, there is a Shutdown option at the bottom.

I have tested this on both a Fat PSP and a Slim PSP with no issues.

WARNING: Make sure you have a recent, working NAND dump before using this app. I accept no responsibility for any damage or lost data.
If you have any issues using this on the Slim PSP (warning about nand/lfatfs_updater.prx), go to the PSP Slim heading below.
 
 
Preparing an ELF file for use with the menu
*******************************************
NOTE: Since 0.4 this is no longer necessary as EBOOT.PBP files can be run directly. However, this is still the recommended way to go.

1) Run PBPUnpacker (http://www.pdc.me.uk/pbpunpacker.php)
2) Open the EBOOT.PBP of the application you want to run
3) Right click DATA.PSP and select Extract...
4) Save it as "whatever-you-want.elf" - the filename will appear on the menu
5) Copy the file to ms0:/elf on you memory stick
6) If the app comes with PRXs, such as IdStorage Manager, copy them to the ms0:/elf folder as well
 
 
Installation
************
- Set up your magic memory stick with Pandora
- Set up your magic memory stick with Despertar del Cementerio v5
- Make a new folder on the root of the memory stick, "elf"
- Move ms0:/TM/DC5/kd/resurrection.elf to ms0:/elf and any other utilies you want access to
- Copy the included resurrection.elf to ms0:/TM/DC5/kd/

OPTIONAL - To enable flash over USB menu:
- Get usb.prx, usbstor.prx, usbstormgr.prx, usbstorms.prx from the kd folder on a 1.50 dump
- Copy them into ms0:/kd on your Des Cem v5 memory stick

OPTIONAL - Extra setup for flash over USB menu to enable official firmware flash0 access:
The latest official firmwares use a new encryption, so you must perform the following steps to enable access to its lflash partition over USB:
Doing this will mess up USB access to 3.71 and lower flash0, and may break Des Cem v3 (not v4/5), so backup the two files replaced.

- Get PRXdecrypter 2.0c from http://www.sendspace.com/file/p5x2nj
- Using PBP Unpacker or a similar tool (as described above), copy the DATA.PSP from the 3.80 updater EBOOT to ms0:/enc on your memory stick
- Run PRXdecrypter, pressing X - this will extract the updater PRXs
- Exit PRXdecrypter, and run it again, pressing X - this will decrypt the updater PRXs
- Rename the newly extracted and decrypted sceLFatFs_Updater_Driver.prx and sceNAND_Updater_Driver.prx in ms0:/enc to lfatfs_updater.prx and nand_updater.prx and copy them to ms0:/kd, overwriting the existing ones (make copies of the old ones first!)
- Start the ELF menu in the usual way and go to the USB menu
- FAT PSP ONLY: Choose the "Force decryption modules to load" option on the USB menu
- The menu will now be capable of accessing 3.80+ OFW flash partitions
 
After completing the above, use Pandora as normal and the menu should load.
 
PSP Slim
********
To prevent the PSP Slim being bricked by flash0 over USB access, the PRXs nand_updater.prx and lfatfs_updater.prx are loaded.
If your ms0:/kd folder does not have these files, you have an invalid Des Cem v5 installation and need to get the files yourself.
To get them, follow the instructions above - "OPTIONAL - Extra setup for flash over USB menu to enable official firmware flash0 access", using the 3.90/4.01 updater rather than 3.80.
 
 
Changelog
*********
0.3a -> 0.4

- Brought hardware identification up to date in line with PSPident

0.3 -> 0.3a
- USB connection now displays bytes read/written for Memory Stick as well as NAND.
- New method of using USB functions - pspbtcnf no longer needs editing. Just drag and drop the 4 USB PRXs into ms0:/kd
- Memory stick cache flushed after disconnection to prevent corruption
- Fixed crash on shutdown

0.2a -> 0.3
- Integrated Flash over USB menu, safe for Slim PSP if you follow the extra instructions
- Cleanup of text display
- Fixed battery info

0.2 -> 0.2a
- Fully detects motherboard revision based on Tachyon and Baryon numbers (hardware revision info)
- Increases screen brightness to 80% (only on the fat PSP).
- Battery info in the top right corner

0.1a -> 0.2
- Applications containing _SLIM or _FAT at the end of the filename (e.g. blah_SLIM.elf) will be greyed out if the menu is not running on that model.
  e.g. keyCleaner_FAT.elf will be greyed out and unselectable on a Slim PSP.
- Minor bug fixes

0.1 -> 0.1a
- Now sets the current working directory, so apps which load PRXs from the same folder as the elf will be fine
- Moved "Now loading.../shutting down..." message
