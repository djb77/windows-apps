PSP Pandora Deluxe v3.3
-----------------------
Created by DJB on 21st December 2009

Release Notes:
---------------
Here you have it, an all-in-one solution for your Pandora Needs.

This program is designed to prepare your PSP Memory Stick to be used with the Pandora 
Battery. Unfortunately this program can not change your Battery to Pandora, however it 
will copy programs to the Memory Stick in order for you to do this yourself.

I hope you enjoy this new release... 

WARNING: THIS PROGRAM WILL FORMAT AND INSTALL THE IPL LOADER TO THE DRIVE LETTER YOU 
SELECT AS YOUR PSP DRIVE, SO MAKE SURE IT IS THE CORRECT DRIVE BEFORE PROCEEDING. I 
DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FORMATTED USB HARD DRIVES ETC...
